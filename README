The problem that we decided to work on was the communication between businesses or institutions with the public. Since covid changes day by day it makes it really hard for the public to constantly know the policies that are in place with a business or institution. That is why we created this web application called The COVID-19 Guide. We used spring boot for the backend and react for the frontend. We also store business and user information using Spring JPA. Are web application has two sides to it. A business side and a public/consumer side. The public/consumer can login or signup when they enter our web application. After they do that they can see all the latest changes that a business might have regarding Covid-19 rules, store hours, store occupancy, and etc... We allow consumers to subscribe to a business, so that they get immediate updates if the business changes any of their information. They can also favorite a business or institution, so that they can find this business/institution more easily the next time they get onto our application. On the business side you sign up or login just like the public/consumer when you enter our web application, and create a business account. This allows you to put all the general information about your business on our web application as well as the unique information that the public/consumer must follow in regards to covid-19. A business or institution can log back into our web application whenever they need to update the different fields that they filled out originally. This allows for a more universal way to communicate between business/institution with the public/consumer.
